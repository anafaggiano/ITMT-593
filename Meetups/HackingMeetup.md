April 19th, 2018
## Recap
Bren White is a Senior Security consultant at NTT Security and a regular speaker for cybersecurity-related events. During this meeting,
he went through all the physical security flaws that a hacker uses to gain access to restricted locations. 
Information systems are today the main tool used in nowadays facilities like exhibition centers. Brent White showed us that those digital
security controls can be easily bypassed to steal information or data using accessible tools like a USB drive or a fake NFC badge. 
He gave us examples of several « McGiver-style missions » hacking. He actually performed well company security breaches. In order to do so,
he used a lot of background preparation. For instance, he tricked a security agent into believing that he was an IT guy that had been
appointed. 
## What I learned
It was really amazing how he was able to trick so many people. It highlighted the fact that the biggest flaw in modern security remain the
people.
