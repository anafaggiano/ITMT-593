# NewSpace Chicago MeetUp report - Navigating Legal Challenges within the Commercial Space Industry
March 6th, 2018.
## Recap
Charles Mudd is a lawyer and founder of a law firm. His law firm represents companies that are willing to enter the space industry : he insisted on the legal side of such a move. As the space industry has been booming these last years, his sector deals with new legal issues.
He told us that they were several layers in this specific legislation area : traditional law, intellectual property, regulatory regime, nuanced law and space law.

The Department of State (DOS) and the Department of Commerce are the two American administration with the biggest roles in the regulation of Commercial Space companies. Especially, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations plays a major rôle in the DOS. Indeed, possible defense tools as chemical substances and propelling power can become weapons when it comes to space travel. Fear of technology illegal exporting leads to Any violation of those regulation can reach a really high cost for the companies.

Once the company respects the ITAR weapon list, it still need to conduct a background and nationality check for all of their employees to prevent sharing critical data with non-allied countries. Companies should also get a license from EAR (the Export Administration Regulation), which offers deals if the company uses technology from or in the US (at least 10% of it).

## What I learned
This meeting was really interesting, I learned a lot about how you have to take the legal aspect into account when you start to build a company. I didn’t realize the stakes were so high.
