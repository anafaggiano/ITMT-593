  Alexa is an intelligent personal assistant developed by Amazon. When one says the word « Alexa », it recognizes the word– Amazon calls it
the wake word, and it starts recording one’s voice. 7 microphones and the beamforming technology allow the recording to be as accurate
as possible, even across a noisy room. Beamforming is a signal processing technology that is used to direct the reception/transmission
on a transducer array in a chosen angular direction. This recording is then sent over the Internet to Amazon.

  Alexa Voice Services then processes the recording. Anyone is allowed to use this service for free to build a home-made Echo. Amazon
offers sample code for building one using a Raspberry Pi on Github at this adress : https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-sample-app. Amazon
wants others to build this service into their products so they can sell you stuff. Every product that has Alexa built in is a device
that can be used to buy stuff from Amazon... 

  Alexa can also work with online services. Link Alexa to Uber, for instance, and you can request an Uber by simply asking Alexa.
